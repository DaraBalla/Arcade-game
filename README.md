#Introduction

My version accessible here: https://daraballa.github.io/Arcade-game/.

The game Classic Arcade Game Clone is a nanodegree project made to make improvements in Object-oriented programming. 

#Instructions

You can move with the player by pressing arrow keys - right, left, up and down. Your goal should be to get the player from the grass (green field) to the see (blue field) and don't be hitted by enemy. 

If you were hitten by the enemy, you are moved to the start point again. If you get to the see (to the end), you have won and an alert window with a congratulation pops up. 

In case, you want to play a game again, you can press an Enter or click on OK button in alert window. If you do not want continue, just close the window with the game.
